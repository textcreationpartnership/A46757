            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE chief Controverſies between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have of late been managed to the beſt advantage on both ſides. The more judicious ſeem to be ſatisfy'd, and others to be tired out with a cloſe and eager debate of above two years continuance; all ſeem to be ſettled now, and fixed in their Principles, and every one ſees, or thinks he ſees on which ſide the Truth lies. I am confident all has been ſaid for Popery that can be ſaid, though I am not ſo well aſſured that much more might not have been ſaid againſt it, which has been ſpared out of a regard to our common Chriſtianity, and to Religion in general, beſides the reſpect due to a great and gratious Prince of that Communion. But our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have not been wanting to their own Cauſe in this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, nor in the leaſt favourable to ours. At firſt, they would ſeem to be ſatisfied, if they could be truly repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and rightly underſtood; but thoſe colours were ſoon wiped off, and ſomething muſt be done to blacken us, when they could not appear ſo lovely as they deſired. Laborious attempts therefore have been made againſt the chief Points of the Reformation; againſt our Office of the Euchariſt, againſt our Church-Government and Ordination, and all this by a Perſon who has been ſo little convinced by theſe Books, that while he had them by him, he liv'd in our Communion for many years, however now they come to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb facs="tcp:60211:3"/>upon him: but if they have no ſpeedier effect upon others than they have had upon him, they ſeem to be deſigned for the Converſion of the next Age, and indeed they hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have had but little ſucceſs upon this. But I leave him to God and to his own Conſcience, though the world may juſtly expect an Account from him, to ſhew that any thing has been ever ſaid to give us a worſe Repreſentation of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery than ſuch a Practice may doe. 'Tis certain, nothing has been left unattempted which might blemiſh the Church of <hi>England</hi> in its Doctrine, or in its Diſcipline. And to give the Work its laſt and heroick Turn, and ſhame Men into a ſenſe of Religion, and into a true Notion of the Catholick Church, Beaſts have been made to diſpute in the <hi>Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence</hi> of Verſe above the ordinary capacities of Men, and if this fails to work upon a ſullen and obſtinate Age, nothing can ever doe it. Herein the Authour follows the wiſedom of the Ancients, who were wont to inſtill their Doctrines by Fables and Alluſions; but, as his manner is, he has mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improv'd this way, beyond whatever the Ancients knew. For their Beaſts were wont to ſpeak as you would imagin Beaſts to do, if they had the uſe of ſpeech; but his Beaſts are all Heroes, and exceed moſt <hi>Men</hi> that ever I met with. <hi>Æſop</hi> and <hi>Phaedrus</hi> were content with Beaſts as they found them; onely they made them prate after a brutiſh kind of Faſhion. <hi>Horace</hi>'s Brutes too were as unheroical Brutes as any of <hi>Æſop</hi>'s, and <hi>Virgil</hi> himſelf could not advance his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beaſts one pitch above their nature: no, his Monarch of the Bees did not, that I can underſtand, make one heroical Buz. But our Poet, to the confuſion of Mankind, has made Brutes ſpeak ſuch rare things as no Man ever ſpoke, nor <hi>perhaps</hi> can underſtand.</p>
            <p>Yet after all that has been ſaid in Verſe or in Proſe againſt us, or in behalf of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I am not convinced but that ſhe is the ſame Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſhe was an hundred years ago; nay, ſhe would not be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:60211:3"/>thought otherwiſe, that were as much as her Infallibility is worth. There is not the leaſt concern of ours to diſcover the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be worſe than ſhe is now repreſented to be, but we ſhould be glad if we were miſtaken, and could find her ſo much altered for the better. It were inexcuſable in us to diſlike, or not to acknowledge any thing of a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which was carried on here by degrees, and we pray God to proſper any Beginnings of it in other Countries: but if the Church of <hi>France</hi> muſt be put upon us for the whole Roman-Catholick Church, and the Sentiments of ſome particular Men for the Doctrines of that Church; if we muſt be perſuaded that all the varieties and diverſities of Opinions in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have ever been infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the ſame, and that <hi>Italy</hi> will ſubſcribe to what <hi>France</hi> ſhall dictate, or that even all or the greateſt part of the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> will agree to the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and refinings; theſe are ſtrange things and will not readily be admitted. <hi>France</hi> has indeed all the Learning of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion confined in a manner within it ſelf, and ſeems to ſet up for an Empire of Arts and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as well as of Arms, and that muſt needs paſs for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctrine that has ſo much Learning, and ſo many Legions to defend it. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have a known diſtinction between the Popery of <hi>France</hi> and the Popery of <hi>Rome,</hi> as F. <hi>Cotton</hi> confeſſed in the Point of Allegiance: and they are of late much concerned for the Intereſt of the <hi>French</hi> Church, and for the Pope's infallibility even in matters of Fact at the ſame time, ſo that if at any time by the Power of <hi>France</hi> they can get a Pope of their Society, by virtue of a very convenient Doctrine, that the Pope may chuſe his own Succeſſour, they have at once an infallible and a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Pope, and then the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Morals may be Goſpel, though the preſent Pope has term'd them ſcandalous; but that may be ſcandalous at one time which is not ſo at another. <hi>[Suarez</hi> aſſerts, that the Pope may change the manner of
<pb facs="tcp:60211:4"/>Election now in uſe, <hi>apud</hi> Carleton <hi>Curſ. Theologic. Tom. Poſter. Diſputat. 22. Sect. 6.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis certain that Popery is carried on in all its heights even in <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, and the <hi>Gallican</hi> Privileges betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that very ſort of Men who would now be thought the chief defenders of them. The Authour of a Book entituled, <hi>The Pernicious Conſequences of the new Hereſie of the Jeſuits againſt the King and the State,</hi> publiſhed <hi>Febr. 1. MDCLXII.</hi> being an Advocate of Parliament, complains that the opinion of the Pope's infallibility had got ground in <hi>France,</hi> and that there was great likelihood of its ſpreading daily, it being the general opinion of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who are a vaſt Body diffuſed throughout all parts of the world, and have the Education of Youth wherever they come. <hi>Duvall</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to introduce this Doctrine into the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> but attempted it warily, ſaying, that neither the one nor the other ſide of the Queſtion is <hi>de fide.</hi> But though he was all his life in great favour at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet has he ſince been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill treated by F. <hi>Raynaud</hi> a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> at <hi>Lyons</hi> for his great caution and reſtraint in a matter of that importance. (p. <hi>85, 86.</hi>) he ſhews that this Doctrine by degrees gained ground, till the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> growing daily more inſolent procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that extravagant Theſis of the College of <hi>Clermont,</hi> wherein they dared to maintain publickly in the midſt of <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf, and in the face of the Parliament, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> has given to all Popes, whenever they ſhall ſpeak <hi>è Cathedrâ,</hi> the ſame Infallibility himſelf had, as well in matters of Fact as of Right. Great care is taken to ſuppreſs all Books which thwart this Doctrine, and to publiſh and give credit to ſuch as may infuſe it. <hi>Baronius</hi> and his <hi>Continuators</hi> are the Authours for Hiſtory chiefly in vogue, and theſe without coming near him in his Excellencies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſurpaſs him in his Faults. He particularly obſerves <hi>Raynaldus</hi> to have been a Man without the Spirit of are Eccleſiaſtick, without ſtyle, without judgment, without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
<pb facs="tcp:60211:4"/>without credit, yet he had the boldneſs to dedicate his eighteenth Tome to the <hi>French</hi> Clergy, and preſented it to the Aſſembly of the Clergy, <hi>1660;</hi> and though this Doctrine of the Authority of Councils is every where ſtyled Schiſmatical and Heretical, the <hi>Pragmatick Sanction</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> outraged, and all the Popes who poſſeſſed the See in <hi>Avignon</hi> during the Schiſm pronounced Antipopes, who are the onely Popes that <hi>France</hi> has acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, though the moſt undefenſible pretences of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are every where juſtified, yet all the disfavour or diſcouragement that Book met with was, that <hi>Raynal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> did not receive a Letter of thanks from the <hi>French</hi> Clergy, as he expected, but no Sentence being paſſed upon it, this ſilence, as my Authour obſerves, will be one day taken for a tacit approbation, and the Abettors of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> believe with great reaſon that they have however gained a main point, ſince there has been nothing poſitively done againſt ſuch a Work preſented to the whole Clergy, beſides the advantage gained by having ſuch Books received and read without prohibition, that may inſtill thoſe Principles, (p. <hi>94,</hi> &amp;c.) whereas the Epiſcopal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> have been treated by the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> to that degree of indignity as to be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged among the condemned Books, without vouchſafing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to clear it with the Biſhops before Cenſure, or to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them any Account of what they thought amiſs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, (p. <hi>71.</hi>)</p>
            <p>After all the hideous outcries againſt <hi>Richerius,</hi> when he requeſted of a certain Biſhop, one of Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi>'s intimate Friends, that he might have a fair hearing, and liberty allow'd him to offer what he had to ſay in defence of his Book <hi>de Eccleſiaſtica Poteſtate,</hi> the Biſhop freely told him, that he had made himſelf ſo many Enemies, not by writing Errours but too plain and unpleaſing Truths, that though there was nothing could be diſproved in his
<pb facs="tcp:60211:5"/>Book, yet the Church-men had much rather have their ſole dependence on the Pope, than to have the perpetual trouble and diſſatisfaction of appearing before Secular Judges. (<hi>Richer.</hi> Pref. ad Conc. Gen.) The Pope promiſed the D. of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> a Cardinalſhip for his Son, if he would deliver him <hi>Richerius</hi> into the Inquiſition; whereupon he was thruſt into Priſon: but the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>Paris</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded for him to the Parliament, and upon a full hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he was releaſed: but the Pope recompenſed the Duke's good will with the promiſed reward to his Son. And when <hi>Richelieu</hi> requeſted a red Hat of <hi>Urban</hi> the Eighth, for his Brother, <hi>Richerius</hi>'s retractation was the price muſt be paid for it. The Apoſtolick Notary comes to <hi>Paris</hi> and is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by F. <hi>Joſeph</hi> a Capuchin, who having left his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent then lived in the City. This F. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was <hi>Richelieu's</hi> Confeſſour, and was employ'd by him to prepare all buſineſs firſt, and then to bring it to him. Butillerius <hi>Pater, &amp;</hi> Joſephus <hi>Capucinus negotia cruda accipiunt, cocta ad Cardinalem deferunt.</hi> (Grot. <hi>Lett. 375. Par. 1.)</hi> In Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Week, an acquaintance of F. <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s, one of the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> and a great Friend, as he pretended, to <hi>Richerius,</hi> is ſent to the good Man to invite him in F. <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s name to dinner, that ſo he might give his opinion in a point of Controverſie. <hi>Richerius</hi> excuſed it, ſaying he never fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented Feaſts, but he would wait upon him after Dinner, but being preſſed to come, not to be uncivil, he comply'd. As ſoon as Dinner was done, a Queſtion was deſignedly mov'd, concerning the Pope's Authority, of which when <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherius</hi> diſcourſed, modeſtly, as his manner was, F. <hi>Joſeph</hi> tells him, now, ſays he, you muſt either retract your Book, which you formerly writ, <hi>de Eccleſiaſtica &amp; Politica Pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi> or die for it: at that certain Ruffians ruſhed forth armed from behind the Hangings, and threatned to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him: in this dreadfull ſurprize, the poor old Man ſubſcribed a Retractation ready prepared and drawn up
<pb facs="tcp:60211:5"/>for him, and immediately was carried home: where, when he conſidered what he had done, he wrote this Account of the buſineſs to his Friend <hi>Moriſotus,</hi> lamenting extremely his own timorouſneſs and fainting under this Calamity ſo much more grievous than Death to him, he had ſcarce ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Letter, but flinging himſelf upon his Bed, he dy'd. <hi>(Claudii Barthol.

            <p>Whilſt theſe are the proceedings againſt the Advocates for the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, its Adverſaries are encouraged, and their Works in high eſteem. The Abridgment of the Councils by <hi>Coriolanus</hi> was printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> and reviſed by a Dr. of the Faculty, though all the contrary Maxims to the Doctrine of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, are ſet at the beginning of the Book as ſo many Catholick Doctrines. And the Councils are publiſhed by men devoted to the Pope: for the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have ever had the Government of the Royal Preſs; and in printing the Councils have left in the Life of <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth, theſe outragious words, as the Advocate juſtly terms them, againſt all <hi>France, Philippum Pulchrum</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liae <hi>Regem juſtè excommunicavit,</hi> and this printed at the King's Houſe, at his own Charges, <hi>(New Hereſie,</hi> p. <hi>100.</hi>) Nor is there the leaſt intimation given that that Pope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Authority, when he threatned to depoſe him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (<hi>vit.</hi> Bonif. <hi>Octavi, Tom. 28. pag. 676.)</hi> And though <hi>Coſſartius</hi> takes notice that <hi>Binius</hi> was miſtaken in ſaying, <hi>Philip</hi> was juſtly excommunicated, whereas he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed at all excommunicated, yet is not one word ſaid, but that he might deſerve to be excommunicated, or any thing to the contrary, but that the Pope did very well in threatning him with Depoſition, <hi>(Conc.</hi> Labbé, <hi>Tom. 2. part. 2. p. 1389.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The judicious Advocate abovementioned, foreſaw what was to be expected from this laſt Edition of the Councils,
<pb facs="tcp:60211:6"/>which was then in hand, for <hi>Labbé</hi> had cauſed a Draught of the Work to be printed, and I am apt to think, that through this Authour's Complaint the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> had more right done it than otherwiſe at would have had. But the Treatiſes prefix't in the <hi>Apparatus</hi> are ſuch as quite overthrow the <hi>Gallican</hi> Privileges, and the Doctrines pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to that Church. For Cardinal <hi>Jacobatius, de Conciliis,</hi> ſets himſelf purpoſely to prove the Superiority of the Pope to a Council, and anſwers all Objections againſt it, (<hi>lib. 10. p. 519. in Appar. Concil.</hi> Labbé:) and in plain terms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Authority of the Decrees of <hi>Conſtance;</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of thoſe known Evaſions, that theſe Decrees were to take place onely in the times of Schiſm between two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Popes, or in caſe of Hereſie, or that it was no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conſtitution, but limited to the preſent exigency of Affairs; in ſhort, he denies that any Conſtitution of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil can bind the Pope, becauſe he has no Superiour but God; and ſo in all points he palpably contradicts the Doctrine of the <hi>French</hi> Church, <hi>(p. 536.)</hi> Paulus Fabulottus, <hi>de Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate Papae ſupra Concilium,</hi> proves his Tenets by all manner of Arguments from Scripture, from Reaſon, from Hiſtory, from Fathers and from Councils; and in his fifth Chap. where he ſhews the Pope's Superiority from Councils, be ſhews particularly that the <hi>French</hi> ought not to except againſt the Authority of the laſt Council of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> becauſe they acknowledge its Authority in enjoying the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges granted them in the Bull of <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, which confirmed it; and it is unreaſonable, ſays he, that they ſhould allow it when it makes for their advantage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it in other matters, (<hi>Fabulott.</hi> ib. p. <hi>69, 70.</hi>) He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſhew that <hi>Martin</hi> the Fifth did by his Bull retract the Decrees of the Fourth and Fifth Seſſions of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> made, ſays he, in Schiſm, by appointing the Queſtion to be put to all ſuſpected of Hereſie, <hi>An credant</hi> Romanum <hi>Pontificem in Dei Eccleſia ſupremam habere Poteſtatem?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60211:6"/>"Whether they believe that the Pope has ſupreme Power 'in the Church of God? And ſo turns the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> upon the <hi>French, (ib.)</hi> In a word, he concludes, that whoever perſiſts obſtinately in the contrary Opinion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo many Councils, (for he produces no fewer than ſix, whereof that of <hi>Conſtance</hi> is the ſecond) muſt needs be an Heretick. He particularly anſwers the Objections brought from the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> in the uſual manner; as for the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> he ſays, all Catholicks confeſs it was not a lawfull Council, when it defined Councils to be above the Pope. At laſt he concludes with admiration, that any one ſhould, to the deſtruction of his Soul, be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe as to call in queſtion ſo certain a Truth, eſtabliſhed on ſo ſtrong Arguments and ſo great Authorities. <hi>Caranza</hi> maintains the Popes Infallibility, and ſays, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubted of 'till the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil. (Controver. 3. p. 112. in Appar.</hi> Labbei.) He ſpends his fourth Controverſie in ſhewing, againſt theſe two Councils, that Pope's are againſt General Councils. <hi>Petrus de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> in his <hi>Monarchia,</hi> runs as high as any of the reſt, and, to make a Pope a complete Monarch, exempts the Clergy from the Obedience, and their Poſſeſſions from the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of temporal Princes. <hi>(in Apparat. p. 155.)</hi> But <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batius,</hi> if it be poſſible, goes beyond this. For he maintains the Depoſing Power, and affirms, that the Pope alone may depoſe Emperours and Kings, and whomſoever he pleaſes, and particularly the King of <hi>France,</hi> and this without the advice and concurrence of his Cardinals; he makes no doubt of his depoſing Power, the onely Queſtion is, whether he can doe it alone without his Cardinals, and he determines in the Affirmative, <hi>(ibid. pag. 329.)</hi> ſo little regard is to be had to that which is eſteemed the Doctrine of the <hi>French</hi> Church, and which ſome would have us think is the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>-Catholick Doctrine; and the Doctrine againſt the Pope's Infallibility, the <hi>Sententie Pariſienſium,</hi> as it is
<pb facs="tcp:60211:7"/>called in contempt, is every where decryed even in <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> at <hi>Cologne</hi> laid down this Rule, <hi>In Cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> Colonienſi, <hi>fol. 132. If any Man examin the Doctrine of the Pope by the Rule of God's Word, and ſeeing that it is different, chance to contradict it, let him be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out with Fire and Sword,</hi> (Walſh <hi>Iriſh</hi> Remonſtr. Treat. <hi>4.</hi> p. <hi>61.</hi>) And both the Clergy and People of the Roman Communion in <hi>Ireland</hi> generally hold the Pope's Infallibility, being influenced by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> as they are in moſt places. Inſomuch that in MDCLXVI. they refuſed to ſign the three laſt of the ſix Propoſitions which the <hi>Sorbon</hi> in MDCLXIII. had preſented to the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King, and to apply them as they did the firſt three, to his Majeſty of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> and His Subjects, though they contain nothing but an Aſſertion of the King's Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, and a Denial of the Pope's Infallibility, (<hi>Iriſh</hi> Remon. Treat. <hi>3. p. 23.</hi>) and <hi>Treat. 4. p. 58.</hi>) This we are told by <hi>One</hi> who is an Advocate for Popiſh Loyalty, and it is confeſſed by <hi>Another</hi> who made it the Buſineſs of his Life to write againſt the Depoſing Doctrine, that this is the Doctrine moſt generally received amongſt thoſe of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. [<hi>Neque quenquam movere debet, ut aliàs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervavi,</hi> (in Apol. num. <hi>4.49.</hi> utì citatur in margine,) <hi>quod opinio haec, quae Summo Pontifici hanc poteſtatem tribuit, communio ſit quàm oppoſita, pluréſque Docto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res eam ſequantur,</hi> &amp;c.] (Widrington, <hi>Diſcuſſ. Diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis Praef.</hi>) So little ſecurity have we that Popery is the ſame thing in <hi>France</hi> that it is at <hi>Rome</hi> and in other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Countries, or that the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s Expoſition is good Popery, even in <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf. But that which is the Doctrine generally taught, we are often told by the <hi>Guide,</hi> is equivalent to the Definitions of a General Council, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as no Council can be known to be general, nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to teach true Doctrine, but by the Reception it
<pb facs="tcp:60211:7"/>meets with from the Church, and ſo the <hi>Miſrepreſenters</hi> will be found to be thoſe that ſoften and palliate Popery, contrary to the ſenſe of the moſt of that Communion.</p>
            <p>I am ſure Cardinal <hi>Poole</hi> and his Synod at Lambeth, MDLVI. were for Popery as it is at <hi>Rome,</hi> they did not content themſelves to fetch it from <hi>France.</hi> For they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Bulla Coenae,</hi> equalling its Authority even to the Decrees of General Councils and Apoſtolical Traditions; and they profeſs to own the full extent of Power attributed to the Pope by the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> (Decret. <hi>2.</hi>) and they quote it in the uſual form, <hi>Quemadmodum etiam in geſtis OEcumenicorum Conciliorum &amp; in Sacris Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus continetur;</hi> not, <hi>Quemadmodum &amp;,</hi> &amp;c. as we are now taught to reade it according to the true Tranſlation, (vid. <hi>Walſh</hi> Lett. to the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> p. <hi>274.</hi>) if ſuch a nicety will make any material difference; and this was done by Cardinal <hi>Poole,</hi> by virtue of his Legantine Power in a Provincial Synod.</p>
            <p>However, the conſtant Appeal now is from the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Private Men and particular Synods, to the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of General Councils, which are appealed to with as much confidence, as if not one of them had ever been ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or called in queſtion, but were all of undoubted Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whereas there is indeed nothing more ſuſpected than the credit of moſt of them, and the chief Tenets of Popery will be found to have but little Authority from General Councils; The <hi>Worſhip of Images</hi> will ſtand in great need of the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Auricular Confeſſion,</hi> &amp;c. will want ſupport from the fourth of the <hi>Lateran;</hi> and, in ſhort, it will be almoſt as difficult to defend the Councils brought to authorize them, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Doctrines themſelves. I think I have made it evident that this Argument from the Authority of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils will be as unſucceſsfull as all other Arguments have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto proved: for it is a vain thing to attempt by any
<pb facs="tcp:60211:8"/>means the Defence of a Cauſe which will not be defended.</p>
            <p>But in my Opinion the famous Mr. <hi>Schelſtrate</hi> has gone the fartheſt towards the finding out an Expedient which may be of equal force in all Controverſies. For in the year MDCLXXXV. he put out a Book intituled, <hi>Diſſertatio A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologetica de Diſciplina Arcani</hi> againſt <hi>Erneſtus Tentzeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divine, in defence of his Commentaries upon the ſecond Canon of the Council of <hi>Antioch.</hi> In this Book he ſhews, that the Church concealed her Doctrines a long time, and that the ſtream of Tradition, like ſome Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, ran for a great way under ground, till at laſt it broke out and diſcovered it ſelf in this <hi>Age</hi> or that <hi>Council.</hi> If you enquire why we reade nothing of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> in Ancient Authours. The Anſwer is very eaſie and ready; <hi>Diſciplina Arcani:</hi> (p. <hi>150, 151.</hi>) Why the Fathers did not aſſert the Worſhip of Images? <hi>Diſciplina Arcani:</hi> (p. <hi>124.</hi>) Why the Doctrine of the Trinity was not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught before the Council of <hi>Nice? Diſciplina Arcani:</hi> (p. <hi>10,—17.</hi>) Why we have no Accounts of the <hi>Seven Sacraments</hi> before the ſeventh Century? <hi>Diſciplina Arcani:</hi> (p. <hi>104,—106.</hi>) Why the Writings of St. <hi>Denys</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reopagite</hi> lay ſo long concealed? <hi>Diſciplina Arcani:</hi> (p. <hi>120.</hi>) And ſo for any Novelty elſe <hi>Diſciplina Arcani</hi> ſtill returns upon you, and it is ſo great a Charm, that ſome would be almoſt afraid of it, for it has a ſtrange faculty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king every thing look <hi>aged</hi> that it can but come near. This <hi>Diſciplina Arcani</hi> is an occult Quality to ſalve all Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by, and ſay what you will, prove what you will, theſe two Emphatical Words ſhall bear down all before them. And, I am perſuaded, the following Conſiderations will ſtand out againſt any Attack but that of <hi>Diſciplina Arcani.</hi>

            <p>I Deſign two Things: Firſt, To ſhew the falſe dealing that has been uſed in putting forth the Councils. Secondly, To ſhew that Papiſts are not agreed in the Authority of them as they are put forth.</p>

               <p>The falſe dealing that has been uſed in putting forth the Councils; And this, 1. By putting forth thoſe that are wholly forged: 2. By ſuppreſſing thoſe that are genuine. 3. By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praving thoſe that are genuine, which they have not thought fit to ſuppreſs.</p>
               <p>§ I. By putting forth thoſe that are forged. Of this number is the Synod pretended to have been held at <hi>Antioch</hi> by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, The eighth Canon whereof is produced for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Images; and the Council of <hi>Sinueſſa</hi> brought by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to prove the Pope above a General Council; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

To paſs by the Acts of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> and the eighty <hi>Arabick</hi> Canons, which ſome are willing to impoſe upon us for genuine, and quote them upon occaſion; though <hi>Baronius</hi> confeſſes the Acts ſuppoſitious, and all Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians teſtifie that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers made but twenty Canons: To paſs by theſe and the early Fraud and inexcuſable Miſtake of putting the <hi>Sardican</hi> Canons into the number of the <hi>Nicene,</hi> to warrant the Right of Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as the many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts, about forged Acts, that have been between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> which ſhall be enquired into when we come to the Caſe of <hi>Photius:</hi> To mention, I ſay, no more of this kind; The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal</hi> Epiſtles, which cannot be denyed to have been forged, and impoſed upon the World by <hi>Iſidore Mercator,</hi> yet have not loſt their place among the Councils, but ſtand there, as if they expected ſome ſecond <hi>Turrianus</hi> to defend them: for unleſs more credit were deſigned them by it than they deſerve, 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable why they ſhould be ſuffered to take up ſo much room, which might be better filled.

               <p>§ II. By ſuppreſſing Councils that are genuine. The firſt and ſecond Councils of <hi>Piſa</hi> are omitted by all the Collectors of Councils before <hi>Labbé,</hi> and the Acts of the ſecond Council are omitted by him too: though the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> was but a Continuation of the firſt <hi>Piſan</hi> Council; and the ſecond being owned by the <hi>French</hi> in derogation to the laſt of <hi>Lateran</hi> was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed out of the <hi>French</hi> King's Library with the former, by the ſpecial privilege of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, <hi>A.</hi> MDCXII. And though <hi>Labbé</hi> thinks fit to excuſe the omiſſion by ſaying, that the Acts and Apology of this pretended Council <hi>[Conciliabulum Piſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num]</hi> were collected by Schiſmaticks and Hereticks, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed under a falſe name; and that <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, in MDXIII. called it onely a pretended Council, and denyed it all favour and aſſiſtence, yet the Royal Approbation of this Edition, and the <hi>exact</hi> agreement of <hi>all</hi> theſe Acts with the Acts of the ſame Council, as we find them in <hi>Richerius,</hi> is a ſufficient evidence againſt the imputation of Forgery; neither need they have been ſo very ſcrupulous upon this Head, who have themſelves inſerted <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Synodical Reſcripts</hi> which they acknowledge to be ſpurious, but a Lye when it makes for them, ſhall paſs with a gentle Cenſure; whereas Truth, when it makes againſt them, ſhall be ſtifled, if any thing like an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe can be brought to palliate their proceedings.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, there is this to be ſaid; That he was engaged in a War with <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at the ſame time, and gained a memorable Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at <hi>Ravenna</hi> over their united Forces; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſetting upon him at home, he was forced notwithſtanding to give over in <hi>Italy,</hi> in MDXIII. and ſo 'tis not unlikely, that, to reconcile himſelf to the Pope, he might then ſend that meſſage; but it is manifeſt from the Acts themſelves and the Letters printed at the End of them, that from the beginning of the Council to that time, he could be no Friend either to the Pope or to his Council. The ſame Year <hi>Julius</hi> dyes, and <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds. A Peace being concluded with <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> taking in Marriage <hi>Mary,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, he prepares for War again in <hi>Italy,</hi> but dyes in MDXV. From whence it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears which Council <hi>Lewis</hi> was moſt for, and for what Reaſon he diſclaimed the Council of <hi>Piſa.</hi>

               <p>The Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> is wholly left out in the <hi>Roman</hi> Edition as ſpurious, and was left out by Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Advice, as <hi>Richerius</hi>

               <p>§ I. PApiſts are not agreed in the Authority of Councils; I mean, they are not agreed what Councils are General, and what are not ſo. They differ as much about the Councils, as they do about the Notes of the Church. For as <hi>Coſterus</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns three, <hi>Coccius</hi> five, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> fifteen, <hi>Bozius</hi> an hundred Notes: ſo ſome aſſign more, ſome fewer General Councils, though the common computation proceeds no higher than to eighteen, of ſuch as are without exception. As the ſeventh and eighth General Councils were not a long time received into the <hi>Profeſſions of Faith,</hi> (which I ſhew in the ſeventh) ſo the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Councils recited in thoſe <hi>Profeſſions</hi> not exceeding eight, as is manifeſt by thoſe <hi>Profeſſions</hi> in the <hi>Diurnus Romanus</hi> publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by <hi>Garnerius</hi> ſhew, that eight onely were looked upon as truly General, and the reſt not as of equal Authority. Cardinal <hi>Contarenus,</hi> in his ſhort account of Councils written to <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, and preſented to him on his calling the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> (or that of the delegated Cardinals in order to it, he being one of the number) reckons that for the eighth General Council, which depoſed <hi>Photius,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> for the ninth, not ſo much as naming any of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councils but the laſt, and not eſteeming either this or that of <hi>Lyons</hi> under <hi>Gregory</hi> the Tenth, nor that of <hi>Conſtance</hi> or <hi>Baſil</hi> General, though he does name them

Cardinal <hi>Pole,</hi> with his Synod at <hi>Lambeth</hi> under <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth <hi>A.

                  <hi>Roccha,</hi> in his Explications, reckons the Council of <hi>Vienne</hi> the fifteenth, and then proceeds to the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> which he calls the eighteenth, as it is indeed computing the two inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> but <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> thought fit to take no notice of them in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> but <hi>Roccha</hi> makes them up a full Score, though the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> be onely ſuppoſed, not expreſſed in the number. So many differing accounts we have concerning the number of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils; to which may be added one more, by taking in the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> as it ought to be in St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s opinion, and in the opinion of <hi>Launoy, Albaſpinaeus, Marca, Labbé, Sirmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> and others

The two latter Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Councils for awhile continue the Tale of them, and the laſt continues it longer than the Royal Edition does, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they break off, and ceaſe numbering, onely giving us them as they come: which may be a farther evidence how little certainty and exactneſs there is in any thing that relates to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of General Councils.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60211:18"/>trouble in defending it: unleſs this be General, the worſhip of Images is at a great loſs for Authority from Antiquity, and yet to defend this Council is almoſt as difficult as to defend the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Images without it.</p>

P.</hi> to null the late Council held there under <hi>Conſtantinus Copronymus,</hi> and to determine for the worſhip of Images: but the People and the Souldiery of the City would endure no ſuch thing, and they had moſt of their own Biſhops ſo far on their ſide as to inſtruct and encourage them againſt ſuch worſhip. The Citizens were not difficultly perſuaded to be conſtant in their old Profeſſon, which Edicts and Councils and their own Practice required them not to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but they were led by too violent a Zeal to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60211:19"/>to a way not juſtifiable, and together with the Souldiers were immediately in an Uproar upon theſe Proceedings of the Empreſs.

One <hi>Baſilius</hi> an Archbiſhop had, it ſeems, in a Profeſſion of Faith, which he read in the Council, inſerted after the Belief in the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, the kiſſing and adoring of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Relicks, adding, that he believed that Sanctification was partaken of from theſe, and leaving out in the mean time the Articles of Remiſſion of Sins, the Reſurrection of the Dead, and Life everlaſting: The Pope reſolved to defend all
<note place="margin">w <hi>Ibidan Act.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 942.</note>, and not to ſtand out in the leaſt at any thing whatſoever, juſtifies <hi>Baſilius,</hi> that ſanctification may be had from Images and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and afterwards maintains

But how ſtout a Champion ſoever the Pope was for the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the Emperour was not in the leaſt ſatisfied, he was for good ſenſe rather than <hi>Honey words,</hi> and therefore calls a Council at <hi>Frankford</hi> DCCXCIV. conſiſting of three hundred Biſhops, who determined ſo una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly againſt the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> think the <hi>Opus Carolinum,</hi> which <hi>Adrian</hi> endeavoured to anſwer was drawn up there. The Pope had his Legates in the Council, but they were either brought to a conſent with the reſt of the Fathers, or however could get nothing by their oppoſition, which perhaps might be the leſs peremptory and pertinacious, and ſo the leſs regarded, becauſe the Emperour himſelf was preſent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thus we ſee that not onely the Acts of the ſeventh General Council have lately been called in queſtion, but that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil it ſelf was at firſt oppoſed by as General a Council held at

For he would perſuade us that the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> Council was confirmed, not condemned by this of <hi>Frankford:</hi> though nothing can be more plain, than that the ſecond Canon condemns the Worſhip of Images in contradiction to a <hi>Greek</hi> Synod, which had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it under pain of Anathema, and herewith agree all the

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60211:21"/>Councils, but had never the good luck to ſucceed, was at laſt in a General Council enjoyned under Anathema: and when the Popes Legates at their coming from the Council brought a Copy of it ſubſcribed by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Irene,</hi> which the ſame Pope that now ſent his Legates to <hi>Frankford,</hi> commanded to be tranſlated into <hi>Latin,</hi> and placed in his Library, when the Pope himſelf had anſwered the objections propos'd by the Emperour againſt this very Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> who can conceive that the whole Tranſaction ſhould not be noiſed abroad and talked of in all places, and among all perſons, and in all its circumſtances ſo exactly known, that it would have been impoſſible to have picked out three hundred men of any tolerable rank and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, who could be ignorant, that the General Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had at length decided the vexatious controverſie about Images? If its judgment had been acquieſced in as infallible, or but of ſufficient Authority to enforce any ſubmiſſion upon the conſcience, it certainly had been taken more notice of, than to be unknown to any man of ordinary obſervation in its leſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial circumſtances of time, and place, and number of Biſhops; the Doctrine however had been taught and practiſed every where among all ſorts of People, or, if it had been rejected by ſome, yet theſe would have found themſelves obliged to give an account, why they rejected it, and ſo to enquire thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into it: but to ſuppoſe ſo many Weſtern Biſhops, with the Pope's Legates among the reſt, and the Emperour himſelf in the midſt of them, ſo groſly and even ſtupidly ignorant, as to know neither the Doctrine it ſelf, nor the place where the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod was held but ſeven years before, is to caſt too great a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh upon the Weſtern Church, and would be apt to make men ſuſpect, that the Weſtern Clergy at that time could make no pretence to the leaſt ſhare of infallibility either in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil or out of it. The Emperour's Book mentions the <hi>Greek</hi> Council as held in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and it were extreme weakneſs to imagine, that <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, after he had been at the pains to write a Book upon the ſubject, or had ordered one to be written, had not intelligence good enough to ſet the Synod right in the circumſtance of place at leaſt, if any will be ſo free with him, as to ſay he was raſh enough to oppoſe he knew not what.</p>

               <p n="6">6. But to free that wiſe and great Emperour, and the whole <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church from ſo ſtupid an abſurdity: It can be no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the Decree concerning Image-worſhip ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the Council of <hi>Frankford</hi> as made at <hi>C. P.</hi> to him, who remembers that the firſt meeting of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers was at <hi>C. P.</hi> and that there firſt they began to Anathematize thoſe, who were againſt the worſhip of Images, but finding <hi>C. P.</hi> too hot for them were forced to remove to <hi>Nice.</hi> And this may give a farther account, why the Doctrine condemned in the Canon of <hi>Frankford</hi> doth not ſo exactly agree with the definition made at <hi>Nice,</hi> where it is probable they might think fit to be more moderate and cautious in their expreſſions, after they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience how ill the Doctrine of Image-worſhip was thought of at <hi>C. P.</hi> and with how great difficulty it was like upon any terms to be received. The Council of <hi>Frankford</hi> might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to uſe the like moderation and not directly to oppoſe that Council in the face of his Legates, which had after a ſort been defended by the Pope himſelf, ſince it was ſufficient in the end of the Canon to add ſuch a clauſe as excludes all worſhip of Images whatſoever: <hi>Qui ſuprà ſanctiſſimi Patres noſtri omnimodis orationem aut ſervitutem eis impendere renuentes contempſorunt atque conſentientes condemnarunt:</hi> They might not be unwilling to ſpare the name of a Council that had gone before them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Hereſie of <hi>Felix,</hi> and <hi>Elipandus,</hi> and after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute between the Emperour and the Pope, the Emperour might perhaps think fit to try this expedient for an Accommodation of a thing that had been of ſo ill conſequence, and ſo might give order to omit the mention of <hi>Nice,</hi> and not to engage the Pope's Legates at <hi>Frankford</hi> to condemn the ſame Popes Legates at <hi>Nice,</hi> but nevertheleſs to have the thing it ſelf condemned as effectually, as if all the Fathers of <hi>Nice</hi> had been particularly named. For it is obſerved that <hi>Charles</hi> the Great and his Son <hi>Lewis</hi> after him had a particular care to give the Popes good words, and to keep fair with them, when they moſt withſtood their deſigns; and thus <hi>Lewis</hi> carryed it in this very caſe of Images, when the worſhip of them was condemned in the Council of <hi>Paris.</hi> This is the account, which to me ſeems moſt probable, but however that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not onely at <hi>Frankford,</hi> but generally in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and ſhortly after in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> too, is as clear as the light. <hi>Maimburg</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:60211:22"/>and <hi>Natalis Alex.</hi> are ſo hard put to it, after all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to palliate and reconcile theſe two Councils, that they are forced to pretend that <hi>Charles</hi> the Great was enraged at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour, becauſe he refuſed to marry his Siſter, and ſo in revenge called this Council at <hi>Frankford</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> and the Images and Image-worſhipers, it ſeems, ſuffered all the hard names and bad uſage at <hi>Frankford</hi> becauſe <hi>Conſtantine</hi> loved Images better than the Lady.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60211:25"/>ever lived, if all be true that his Enemies relate of him. They ſay that his Mother, when ſhe went with child of him, dreamt that ſhe ſhould bring forth a Serpent, which with his noiſome Breath ſhould infect the whole Eaſt; and many holy Men foretold the ſame thing in plainer language to her, that ſhe ſhould be delivered of one who would be the ruine of the Church: this troubled her ſo much that ſhe often endeavoured to deſtroy her ſelf, rather than that ſuch a Brat ſhould ever be born into the World: but her Husband prevented the deſign; and ſhe was at laſt perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by devout People about her to ſubmit to the Providence of God: ſo ſhe was prevailed with to live, and, to her great ſorrow, was Mother of a Son who outwent all theſe Prophecies.

The next Queſtion will be, where the Forgery lies, and who is to be taxed with it. To go no farther, the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> Original of this fourth Council of <hi>C. P.</hi> differ very much: for beſides other Variations, there are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60211:27"/>twenty ſeven Canons in the <hi>Latin</hi> and but fourteen in the <hi>Greek,</hi> yet both of them muſt paſs for authentick enough, though the ſeventeenth of the additional Canons will give the <hi>French</hi> ſome pains to reconcile it to the practice of their Church. For it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points that all Metropolitans ſhall meet in Council at the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of their Patriarch, notwithſtanding any prohibition from the ſecular Magiſtrate, and that Princes ſhould not be preſent in any but General Councils: both which are contrary to the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the <hi>French</hi> Church: For their Princes are wont to be preſent in their National and Provincial Synods, and their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, if they be detained by command from the King, think that a ſufficient excuſe for abſenting themſelves from any Synod their Patriarch ſhall call them to. Two eminent Prelates of that Church, <hi>de Marca</hi> and <hi>Boſquet,</hi> have endeavoured to explain this Canon ſo as to juſtifie their own Doctrine and Practice: but <hi>Chriſtianus Lupus</hi> was ſo little ſatisfied with the attempt, that he exclaimes againſt it, as becoming rather <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> or <hi>Acacius</hi> of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> than Biſhops of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and whereas they alledge the Authority of <hi>Hincmare</hi> of <hi>Rhemes;</hi> he plainly ſays, that they might as well have alledged <hi>Luther's</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony againſt the Council of <hi>Trent. Natalis Alex.</hi> interpoſes to mediate the buſineſs, and would willingly make up the Debate; with what ſucceſs let <hi>Lupus</hi>'s Party judge. But ſtill theſe Canons muſt be all acknowledged authentick, though they are not in the <hi>Greek;</hi> but if the <hi>Greek</hi> differ from the <hi>Latin</hi> in any thing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial that goes in the leaſt againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> loud Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries are preſently made of <hi>Falſhood</hi> and <hi>Forgery.</hi> For the Charge here ſeems to lye not againſt <hi>Photius</hi> alone, but againſt all the <hi>Greeks</hi> in general, even from the ſecond to the eighth General Council.

This is ſuch an odd kind of Cheat, that it lays one thing to his charge, which his worſt enemies never durſt brand him with, and is ſo great an Inſtance of Folly, that it ruines all the reſt of the Character they have been pleaſed to beſtow upon him: for it is acknowledged on all hands, that he was peculiarly eminent for his Learning, and for that which his Enemies call <hi>ſubtilty,</hi> and his Friends <hi>wiſedom.</hi> That <hi>John</hi> the eighth did conſent that <hi>Photius</hi> ſhould be Patriarch is not denyed, nor that he ſent his Legates with Inſtructions for that purpoſe, as both his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> and his <hi>Commonitorium</hi> certifie. So far no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery is pretended: but they ſay, <hi>John</hi> never conſented to the abrogating of the fourth Council of <hi>C.

               <p n="7">7. But, firſt, it is certain that the reſtoring of <hi>Photius,</hi> and the owning him not onely for a Patriarch, but even for a Biſhop one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is ſo far a derogation to this Council, which fourth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non decrees that <hi>Photius</hi> is no Biſhop, and pronounceth all his Epiſcopal Acts void: ſo that the Council which afterwards by the conſent and approbation of <hi>John</hi> the eighth, acknowledges <hi>Photius</hi> for a Biſhop and a Patriarch too, does moſt certainly declare this whole Canon null, and bids fair towards the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying all that is pretended to be forged in <hi>John</hi>'s Epiſtles. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think the Alterations in theſe Epiſt. by whomſoever they were made, are ſo ancient as <hi>Photius</hi>'s time, perhaps they may be much later than <hi>Ivo Carnutenſis;</hi> but if they be of ſo ancient date, and if it be true, that this Pope afterwards recalled his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and renounced communion with <hi>Photius,</hi> and anathematized him and his own Legates for no other reaſon, but becauſe he was laugh'd at for a <hi>Tame-man</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60211:28"/>never juſtifie their pretenſions: which had been no more, ſays he, than our Anceſtours have ſaid before, as he there ſhews by particular Inſtances.

<note n="q" place="margin">Anaſt. <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. col.</hi> 967.</note> had excommunicated and depoſed Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and though he was himſelf afterwards depoſed, yet was he reſtored without the Pope's leave or knowledge, onely the Pope had ſome hopes of having his pretenſions to <hi>Bulgaria</hi> ſucceed, and upon that ſent to ratifie what he could not hinder, but when he

Now can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not I be perſuaded, that <hi>Photius,</hi> if he could be ſo baſe and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as to make a thouſand Forgeries, would yet doe it here: when he could not hope to be undiſcovered, or would conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to uſe ſuch vile and fooliſh Arts, onely to countenance his proceedings with the appearance of that Authority, which he had in ſo much ſcorn and defiance. This would be, as if Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> after he had renounced the Pope's Supremacy, ſhould have falſified the Bulls, which the Pope diſpatched hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto for his promotion to the See of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> The <hi>Greeks,</hi> we have ſeen, looked upon this as the healing Synod, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> had reconciled all differences amongſt them by making void the Council held againſt <hi>Photius,</hi> and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling him in his See again, and therefore whatever heats had paſſed between <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Photius</hi> (as it often happens between very good men, and had happened between their own St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi>) yet now theſe things being compoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a happy peace and ſettlement, notwithſtanding the Pope's Anathema, they received the names of both <hi>Photius</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> into their <hi>Diptychs,</hi> and regiſter'd them among their Saints whom they moſt ſolemnly commemorate in their Prayers.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There are ſo many Improbabilities in the Story againſt <hi>Photius,</hi> that they will hardly gain belief without a Miracle, and therefore we are told that in the Council held againſt him at <hi>Rome,</hi> under <hi>Adrian</hi> the Second, when the Book which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Vindication, after it had been trampled upon by all
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60211:29"/>the <hi>Reverend Aſſembly,</hi> was at laſt thrown by his Holineſs into the fire; the flames catched at it and devoured it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in a ſtrange manner, with a noiſome ſmell, and a kind of Pitch colour tinctured the fire; and beſides, a great ſhowr hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening at the ſame time increaſed the flames as if ſo much Oil had been thrown upon them. And now who is ſo hardy as to deny the Authority of any thing that was ſaid or done againſt <hi>Photius,</hi> or to doubt but that the fourth Council of <hi>C.

               <p>§ VIII. The imperfect account we have of the three firſt <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran</hi> Councils ſerves onely to ſhew the little eſteem which was formerly had of them;

All this, one would think, were ſufficient to put the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the fourth Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> beyond all contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or debate: for who can imagine that a Council celebrated with ſo much ſolemnity, which decided Controverſies of ſo mighty concernment in the Church, and determined things of continual uſe among all ſorts and Orders of Men, ſhould not immediately meet with the moſt entire ſubmiſſion, and always retain an undoubted Authority and veneration. Thus much would have been due, if it had not been infallible; but being infallible, what regard muſt every Age, and every Nation, and every Writer, at leaſt every <hi>Traditionary</hi> Chriſtian pay to it! yet this very Council ſo famous and ſo renowned in its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſo extraordinary in its Determinations and Decrees, lay dormant, unregarded and unknown till the year MDXXXVII. that is, till above CCC. years after it was held. 'Tis very ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing that neither <hi>Innocent</hi> himſelf, nor his Nephew and next Succeſſour but one, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Ninth, who publiſhed his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle's Decretal Epiſtles, and theſe very Decrees, which now paſs for the Decrees of this Council among the reſt, ſhould put this forth among the other General Councils; 'tis ſtrange that no other Pope or Biſhop, or at leaſt ſome Canoniſt or other learned man ſhould ever think of it, but 'tis yet more ſtrange that <hi>Merlin</hi> in his Councils printed but three years before the fourth Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> was publiſhed, ſhould omit this, though he ſets down the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil.</hi> But when this Council did come to light, with what Credentials did it come? what evidence does it bring for its Authority? is it printed from ſome ancient Manuſcripts in the <hi>Vatican?</hi> it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60211:31"/>might then be wondred how it ſhould lie ſo long concealed, never publiſhed, never quoted, nor mentioned, but 'tis a much greater wonder, how the Pope's own Library, ſo fam'd for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts, ſhould miſs of this, where ſo much of Popery, and the principal and niceſt part of it, his own Prerogative, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Would the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> keep no authentick Records in a thing of this nature, which ſo nearly touches them? They are not uſed to be ſo careleſs in theſe matters: the other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, as <hi>Coſſartius</hi> would perſuade us, had all of them Copies, and the Decrees were turned into <hi>Greek</hi> for that very purpoſe, how came the Pope himſelf then to have none, or where had the Copies of the other Patriarchs lain ſo many hundred years hid? it was perhaps from one of thoſe Copies, that we have now the Decrees of this Council: no ſuch matter; but <hi>Johannes Cochleus</hi> a <hi>German</hi> one of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Adverſaries produces them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter above CCC. years concealment, and about XX. years after the Reformation begun by <hi>Luther</hi> out of ſome obſcure Manuſcripts, and ſends them to <hi>Peter Crabbe</hi> to be annexed to his Councils, and what was wanting in that, has been picked up here and there, and pieced together ſince.</p>

But this is to bring us back again from a Council to the Pope, and from him to ſend us to the Church diffuſive, to inquire into her Faith and Practice, and ſo we are diſappointed of the vaſt hopes conceived from ſo numerous an Aſſembly.

Well, but the Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghoſt, and the true notion of the Trinity muſt be called in queſtion, if we reject this Council: by no means, becauſe this had been explained in other Councils as far as was neceſſary, and the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Manuſcripts of <hi>Coſſartius</hi> leave out the Proceſſion, ſo that that was, it ſeems, but in ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, and cannot be proved from this Council.

<note n="e" place="margin">Widring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <hi>ib. p.</hi> 20.</note>, that the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> meant not this Council, but that of <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, and that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſpoke according to the common opinion, that is, in plain terms, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and that in a matter of no ſmall conſequence: for if one General Council tell the world that another is General which really is not ſo, what aſſurance can men have of any Council, that it is General? or what Errours may not a General Council by this means lead men into? What they anſwer to the Teſtimony of the Council held at <hi>Oxford</hi> ſo ſoon after I am yet to learn: but it can be no wonder that our Clergy ſhould at that time yield to any thing the Pope deſired when the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had had ſo freſh an Inſtance of his Power, who had been ſuſpended in this very Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and was willing to comply with any thing that might advance his Intereſt at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope openly ſtyled King <hi>John</hi> his Vaſſal, and had reduced all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſuch dependence and obedience, that there was not one of thoſe ſecular Princes and States, that gave their attendance at this Council, but were ſome way or other obnoxious to him and ſtood in awe of him, the <hi>Croiſade</hi> left the Popes at liberty to play their own game at home, and had gained them more in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> than could ever be gotten by all the Councils that were ever called. <hi>Henry</hi> Brother to <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> was then poſſeſſed of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with the Title and Honour of <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour, and the four Eaſtern Patriarchs were all Weſtern Biſhops, one <hi>Frenchman</hi> and three <hi>Italians,</hi> who held their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archates of the Pope, and were never owned in their reſpective Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Sees. Upon this account 'tis rather ſtrange that any demur ſhould be made to this Pope's Dictates in Council, or that this Council ſhould not be every where reverenced as an Oracle, than that one Nation, which had ſmarted ſo much under the Pope's diſpleaſure, ſhould acknowledge it in his Succeſſour's days; for <hi>Honorius</hi> the Third was no degenerate Succeſſour to <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, and our Nation then had learnt to ſubmit to harder terms than theſe: yet ſure there muſt be ſomething in theſe Decrees very irkſome, which could not paſs the Votes

<note place="margin">The Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> MCCCCXXXI.</note> was but the practick and executive part of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and therefore in the ſecond Seſſ.
<note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. § 1.</note> they lay down the fourth and fifth Seſſ. of <hi>Conſtance</hi> as the ground and Foundation upon which all their proceedings were to depend. This ſtartled Pope <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> ſo that he immediately ſent to his Legate to diſſolve this Council and indict one at <hi>Bononia,</hi> under pretence of receiving the <hi>Greeks</hi> there with more conveniency, and thither he would come and preſide in perſon. The Cardinal St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> his <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi> diſſuades him all he can. The Synod in the mean time is dealt with about a diſſolution by the Biſhops of <hi>Tarentum</hi> and <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> but is refractary; and in the third Seſſion deſires his Holineſs not to be troubleſome, they recount to him the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> concerning a Council's being above the Pope; in a word, they tell him plainly, 'tis not in his power to diſſolve them. In the twelfth Seſſion, they ſet him a time, in which if he think fit to join himſelf to the Council, well; if not, they cannot help it, he muſt take what follows: the time ſet was at firſt ſixty days, and in the thirteenth Seſſion, becauſe theſe were expired, and he had not revoked his Bulls, whereby he pretended to have diſſolved the Council, he is accuſed of Contumacy; yet in the fourteenth Seſſion they were ſo kind as to enlarge the time to ninety days, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe three ſeveral forms to him, by which he might acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Authority of the Council and join himſelf to it. The Pope could not but remember how the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> had dealt with three of his Predeceſſours, and ſo at laſt is brought to a compliance: he owns the Council to be general, and recalls the Bulls iſſued forth for its diſſolution, and declares them void, and that the Council is and had been all along from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning legal, and that his Bulls to diſſolve it did not in the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate its Authority. Hereupon his Legates are admitted into
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60211:39"/>the Council, but not before they had been ſworn to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the fourth and fifth Seſſion of <hi>Conſtance</hi> which define the Superiority of Councils. This was done in the 16th Seſſion, but would not ſuffice it ſeems; for in the eighteenth Seſſion they again repeat and renew theſe Decrees now a Fifth time, and give this reaſon for it, becauſe it highly concerned the whole Chriſtian World to be certified in the point that the Pope in three caſes is inferiour to a Council, <hi>viz.</hi> when matters of Faith, or the extirpation of Schiſm, or the reformation of the Church <hi>in Capite &amp; Membris</hi> is in agitation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now one would imagine all had been well between the Pope and the Council; yet no ſooner was the Emperour <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> dead, of whom he ſtood moſt in awe; but <hi>Eugenius</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points a Council at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and that of <hi>Baſil</hi> is as angry and peremptory with him as ever; and, Seſſion the twenty ſixth, ſends him word, that unleſs he appear either in perſon or by his Legate within ſixty days, they will proceed againſt him; and they are as good as their word, for at the end of that term of time, they pronounce his Bull void, and ſhew the invalidity of it in all particulars, inſiſting on the Council of <hi>Conſtance:</hi> Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the thirty third, they proceed yet higher; and in vindication of that Council pronounce all thoſe Hereticks, that deny the Superiority of Councils, and hereupon pronounce <hi>Eugenius</hi> not onely a Heretick, but a Heretick relapſed; and this they did after the moſt ſtrict and deliberate determination, in the moſt deliberate and ſolemn manner.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thus we ſee the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> were in five ſeveral Seſſions confirmed by this of <hi>Baſil,</hi> all which were ratified by <hi>Eugenius</hi> himſelf; and <hi>Pius</hi> the Second, in the ſame Bull, whereby he retracts that which he had written for the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> againſt <hi>Eugenius,</hi> formally approves the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> without making any Exceptions; beſides, they were twice confirmed after his falling off from the Council, and all thoſe were declared Hereticks, not excepting <hi>Eugenius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that ſhould oppoſe this Doctrine: ſo that in the ſenſe of this Council, and of thoſe that acknowledge its Authority about half of the Roman Communion are Hereticks, and particularly <hi>Eugenius,</hi> with all the Popes ſince his time. <hi>Panormitan</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Richer. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. § 5.</note> indeed undertook to prove that <hi>Eugenius</hi> was no Heretick, but was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by <hi>Segovia;</hi> and <hi>Almain</hi> Preſident of the Council, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60211:39"/>
                  <hi>Panormitan</hi> himſelf afterwards wrote a Treatiſe, <hi>Pro authoritate, veritate &amp; juſtitia, Baſileenſis Concilii;</hi> For the authority, truth "and juſtice of the Council of <hi>Baſil:</hi> Which makes it evident, that what he before ſaid, was rather to ſerve his Maſter the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> then Feudatory to the Pope, than to ſpeak his own ſenſe, and indeed there were none but the Biſhops of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> that withſtood the Decree. 'Tis very well known how wonderfully the Popedom illuminated <hi>Pius</hi> the Second, and <hi>Julian</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Sancta Crux,</hi> who had been as ſtout a Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> at laſt was brought over to the Pope's Faction.

<note place="margin">C. of <hi>Trent, An. Dom.</hi> MDXLV.</note> 1. We are come at laſt to the famous <hi>decreeing, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, defining</hi> Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which is ſo well known, that very little needs here be ſaid of it. The <hi>French</hi> Clergy, it muſt be confeſſed, and all others who maintain the Pope to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a General Council, are extremely obliged to Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth: for, if we believe Cardinal <hi>Pallavicini,</hi> and the <hi>Guide in Controverſies</hi> who ſays it after him, that Pope had nine parts of ten in the Council ready to vote the Pope ſuperiour to a General Council, and yet ſuffered the Controverſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as it was. And indeed the Pope, if he had found no other reſtraints upon him, but what were in the Council might have done his pleaſure in any thing: for there were CLXXXVII. <hi>Italians,</hi> and but LXXXIII. of other Nations, ſo that the <hi>Italians</hi> exceeded all other Nations beſides by CIV. a ſmall number to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a caſting Vote, who then can deny, that the Pope was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and was abſolutely certain to gain his point?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But I ſhall onely obſerve, that the Decrees of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not in force to this day in <hi>France,</hi> becauſe they are thought to encroach upon the Privileges of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church: and therefore whenever
<note n="d" place="margin">Gerbais <hi>de Cauſis Majoribus, p.</hi> 347.</note> the Aſſembly of the Clergy or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France</hi> have dealt with the King about the Reception and Publication of that Council, they have always put in an Exception to reſerve the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church entire.

                  <hi>Low Countries</hi> when <hi>Margaret</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma,</hi> then Governeſs there, required the Magiſtrates of every Province to make ſearch, whether any thing in the Decrees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> were contrary to the Rights of his Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, or to the ancient cuſtoms of their Countrey, they animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted upon ſeveral Chapters, particularly upon <hi>C.</hi> 5. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 24.

               <p n="3">3. I think nothing can be a greater Evidence, that this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was not General than the oppoſition of National Churches in behalf of their particular Privileges in points of Reformation: for a General Council may undoubtedly preſcribe to particular Churches in matters of Diſcipline, as the firſt General Councils did, and oblige them to a compliance for the peace and benefit of the whole, and the Council muſt be judge what is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to that end. To deny this Authority to a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is plainly to lay its Authority quite aſide, and to receive one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as much of it as particular Churches ſhall think fit: for it were an extravagant thing to demand abſolute obedience and ſubmiſſion in matters of Faith, when points of Diſcipline are inſiſted upon againſt the expreſs Decrees of the Council: a Council may err in Doctrine, but if it have any Authority, this muſt extend at leaſt to points of Diſcipline, which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves indifferent, and may be altered, as it ſhall ſeem moſt conducing to the good of the whole Church.

The erecting the Churches of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chates, and the ſettling of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was performed in the four firſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, yet nothing was objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Authority of Councils in ſuch Affairs, nor did the Churches placed under the Patriarchates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> inſiſt upon their particular Privileges;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60211:43"/>onely the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was unwilling to have <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> equalled to her ſelf, and therefore made a troubleſome but fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs oppoſition in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But if at this day the Church of <hi>France</hi> be ſo jealous of her Privileges in matters of Diſcipline, we have much more reaſon to be carefull of the Privileges of our common Chriſtianity in matters of Faith; if ſhe inſiſt that her Biſhops have Authority to decide the <hi>Cauſae Majores,</hi> i. e. all Debates ariſing, whether in matters of Faith or Diſcipline, according to the Decrees of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils; how can it be denied us to defend the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Faith according to General Councils truly ſuch? if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Decrees of Reformation, how ſhall we ſubſcribe Pope <hi>Pius</hi>'s Creed? nay how ſhall they ſubſcribe it? not by virtue of any obligation from this Church but becauſe they otherwiſe think the Articles of it True; and for the contrary reaſon we cannot ſubſcribe them becauſe we think them falſe: ſo that the Authority of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> is really laid aſide on both hands, and the merits of the cauſe muſt be the onely thing in Debate. For to ſay that a General Council properly ſpeaking cannot abridge a particular Church of her Privileges, is to ſay that a particular Church is above a General Council, or at leaſt exempt from its Juriſdiction. This is well enough underſtood at <hi>Rome</hi> where <hi>Gerbais</hi>'s Book in defence of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Privileges is condemned.</p>
               <p>§ XVIII. I have done now with their Councils; and have ſhewn how far Papiſts themſelves have been from thinking them infallible, or from acknowledging moſt of them to be General, whatever credit they may have gained by the ignorance and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of latter Ages, when every Aſſembly of Biſhops greater than ordinary was eſteemed a General Council, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry General Council voted it ſelf infallible. For 'tis certain that in the moſt ignorant Ages, they firſt fanſied themſelves infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and then took the liberty to ſay and doe what they thought fit, and ſo impoſed many ſuperſtitious conceits and gainfull Projects on the world for infallible Truths. It now remains onely to conſider, whether we can meet with any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfaction from the conſent of the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and to enquire whether there be any expedient to reconcile theſe differences concerning the Authority of their ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60211:43"/>But here we are ſo far at a loſs, that we find them in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more diſagreeing, than in the very Fundamental Point, upon which all the Authority of Councils depends; and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing in this, they muſt be at an eternal diſagreement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Councils themſelves. For ſome making the Pope above a General Council, others a General Council above the Pope, and a third ſort making them co-ordinate; thoſe that place infallibility in the Pope alone, have little reaſon to regard a Council; and thoſe that place it in a Council alone, do upon occaſion as little reſpect the Pope, or judge of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils by <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Rule, and ſeek no farther than for the Pope's confirmation; but thoſe that think it is in neither ſeparately, can acquieſce in the Determinations neither of Pope nor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, unleſs they both concur unanimouſly in their Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and whoever make the Church diffuſive to be the Judge of what Councils are General, and what are not ſo, are ſtill at a wider difference from all the reſt.</p>
               <p>§ XIX. Our Engliſh Papiſts ſeem generally to be of the laſt Opinion, placing the Authority of the Church in the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Pope with a General Council, but making the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of General Councils to depend upon the Reception of the Church diffuſive, hereby placing the Authority, <hi>Executively,</hi> onely in General Councils confirmed by the Pope, but <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally and radically</hi> in the Church, upon whoſe Approbation all depends, but by Church they underſtand onely the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of it, and ſuch as would have had a right to vote, if they had been aſſembled in Council. This is the Doctrine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in the Book ſo much valued by our Engliſh Papiſts, <hi>The Guide in Controverſies,</hi> and becauſe this way has moſt Artifice and Amuſement in it, they are willing to put the iſſue here, though moſt of their Prieſts muſt needs have great Prejudices againſt it from a foreign Education: For the <hi>French</hi> are of the ſecond opinion, and the Pope with all his Adherents of the firſt.</p>
               <p>How well the <hi>Guide</hi>'s Hypotheſis has been accepted abroad, I am not able to ſay; but it will be beſt gueſſed at by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that has been about the two other opinions, whether the Parties ſeem inclinable to admit of the <hi>Guide</hi> as a <hi>Reconciler.</hi>

               <p>§ XX. The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> are for no leſs than a Perſonal Infallibility in the Pope, and that in matters of Fact. This is the Diſpute ſo hotly debated of late years between them and the <hi>Janſeniſts.</hi> For the Pope having condemned five Propoſitions in a Poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Book of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> entituled <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> Forms were drawn up to be ſubſcribed under pain of Excommunication, though the Propoſitions could no where be found in that Book. But as the Flatterers of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> firſt raiſed the Pope above a General Council to ſecure him againſt the Reformation in <hi>Capite &amp; Membris,</hi> which the other Biſhops have ſo often requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have extended his Infallibility yet farther, even to matters of Fact, and ſo whatever he determins muſt be right in all caſes. It was upon theſe grounds, that Subſcription was to be made to the five Propoſitions by the Seculars and by the Regulars of both Sexes, and was enforced not onely by the Pope, but by the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. Notwithſtanding, certain Divines, and the Nuns of the <hi>Port Royal</hi> reſuſed to make the Subſcription enjoyned, not that they made any ſcruple of the Doctrine it ſelf, which they were required to acknowledge, but becauſe the contrary to it was no where to be found in the Book condemned, but the Pope, they ſaid, had been impoſed upon by thoſe who pretended to have taken the Propoſitions out of that Book. Hereupon aroſe a Controverſie concerning <hi>the Infallibility of the Church</hi> and of the Pope, the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that the Pope cannot be miſtaken in a matter of Fact, and that therefore the Propoſitions are in that Book: whatever ordinary Readers may think of it, his Holineſs has determined ſo, and he cannot be miſtaken. For they

This is but what the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that famous Theſis of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 12.

But however the Church of <hi>France</hi> might ſtand affected towards the Pope at that time and in that affair, yet the opinion againſt the Pope's Infallibility is ſo generally maintained in that Church, that it is almoſt peculiar to it, and is termed
<note n="g" place="margin">New He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> p. 79.</note> by the <hi>Jeſuites, Sententia Pariſienſis.

This they did <hi>March</hi> the firſt, and aſterwards, for three months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in their ſeveral Aſſemblies, which were no leſs than fourty five in number, the Queſtion was propounded to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted upon; and when they had by this means throughly debated and concluded the Controverſie, they declared, That the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as it excludes Biſhops and General Councils from that Authority which they have immediately from <hi>Chriſt</hi> in judging in matters of Faith is raſh, erroneous, contrary to the practice of the Church and to the Word of God, as well as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Doctrine of the Faculty. This anſwer the Faculty of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> gave to the queſtion <hi>May</hi> the eighteenth, and then review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it the day following, confirmed it moreover from the ſeveral Cenſures which had been formerly paſſed by their Body in this and former Ages upon ſuch Tenets.

Schelſtrate</hi> quotes Nine Manuſcripts of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Maimbourg</hi> Ten; and, which is very ſurpriſing, the Manuſcripts on both ſides have all the Appearance of being Authentick which can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, if we may believe one of our own Church, who is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry able Judge in thoſe matters: But <hi>Maimbourg</hi> has out quoted him by one, and whether it be in confidence of this odds, or for ſome other reaſon, he is poſitive, that the Decrees of a General Council are valid without the confirmation of the Pope.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:60211:45"/>
               <p>§ XXII. Thus we ſee that notwithſtanding the glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to Unity and the Advantages of an Infallible Church ſo much magnified, the diviſions concerning Infallibility are ſo many and ſo great, that it is onely a fine pompous thing, that may ſerve them to boaſt of, but is otherwiſe of no uſe. For we have at this day the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> againſt the <hi>Janſeniſts;</hi> M. <hi>Schel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> againſt M. <hi>Maimbourg;</hi> and <hi>Nine</hi> Manuſcripts againſt <hi>Ten;</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gran</hi> againſt the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris;</hi> and the Synod of <hi>Hungary</hi> againſt that of <hi>France.</hi> Amidſt ſo much oppoſition, how ſhall we hope to find any agreement? The grand Debate between theſe two contending Parties is, whether the Pope or a General Council ſhould have the Preheminence? There is but one way more of diſagreement poſſible in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which is, that neither Pope nor Council is ſuperiour, but that the joint Definitions of both are infallible: this way the <hi>Guide in Controverſies</hi> and his Followers here in <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>gland</hi> take. If the nature of the thing would admit any more differences of opinion, they would undoubtedly be as numberleſs as they are oppoſite, in a diſpute which has ſo much of Prejudice and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and ſo little of Reaſon or Scripture in it. Neither is there any way to reconcile theſe contrary Doctrines, unleſs they would all conclude in that, which they all help to prove, <hi>viz. That there is no ſuch thing as an Infallible Judge or Guide here on Earth.</hi> The Pope in the mean while, whom one would think it moſt concerns to interpoſe his Authority and decide the difference, yet ſits by as Neuter, countenancing and encouraging the one, but not by any Authoritative Act diſavowing the other opinion: And indeed how is it poſſible for him by his Authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the Controverſie, when his Authority is the very thing in controverſie?</p>
               <p>When, I ſay, there is no way beſides of diſagreement poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this matter, I ſpeak onely of the Point now before us, and would not be thought by any means to exclude the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Oral Tradition, nor the Infallibility of the Church dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive, including every member of it, nor any other Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which can be named, but theſe are diſliked as much by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts abroad as they are by Proteſtants at home, and are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſiſtent with the Authority of Councils.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:60211:46"/>
               <p>§ XXIII. From what has been ſaid, I ſuppoſe it evident, that General Councils cannot be relyed upon as Infallible, if there were no other reaſon againſt it but this, that it is ſo uncertain and doubtfull which Councils are General. And I can foreſee nothing that can be objected againſt this Conſequence, but that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> comprehends all the reſt, and is inſtead of All. Which indeed magnifies the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> very much, but is not ſo much for the credit of all the General Councils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; for, beſides that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> grounds many of her Definitions upon the Authority of General Councils that went before, I conceive that all who lived three hundred years ago were as much concerned to know what Councils were Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral as any Body can be at this day, and an Infallibility which could be of little or no uſe till ſince the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> is ſomething ſuſpicious, unleſs we had better proof than the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of that Council to recommend it. I have ſhewn that that Council it ſelf is not received in <hi>France</hi> as a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but onely its Doctrines acknowledged for true, as they were acknowledged, they tell us, before the Councils ſitting: for any thing farther they deſire to be excuſed. And how can that Council be General enough to be Infallible, which is not ſo far General as to oblige a particular Church in points of Diſcipline? 'Tis apparent from the account I have given of them, that we have but the four or almoſt but the ſix firſt General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils without Exceptions, and thoſe moſt of them very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable too, ſo that when all is done, we have no reaſon that I can ſee, not to be contented with our ancient Creeds, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of the firſt Ages which have been acknowledged by all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they teach the Faith neceſſary to the Salvation of all, while others who have taught ſome particular fancies, have found a ſuitable reception.</p>
               <p>§ XXIV. But if all the eighteen Councils were as General as they are pretended to be, yet it is no good Conſequence, that they are infallible. I could never yet ſee any Grounds from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity to believe the Infallibility of General Councils: I am ſure St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60211:46"/>the four firſt General Councils to the four Goſpels, but none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and thereby puts a manifeſt difference between General Councils, and ſo could not hold all to be infallible. If we meet with high Expreſſions in the Fathers concerning the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary aſſiſtence of the Holy Ghoſt in General Councils, I know no man but will acknowledge it, if they ſay, that the Holy Spirit did effectually guide them in the Truth, this is no more than we always profeſs to be believe, that the Firſt Councils did determine Infallible Truths, and ſo were not miſtaken in their Determinations, but it is but an ill conſequence to ſay, that they could not be miſtaken, becauſe they were not, or that all ſucceeding Councils cannot poſſibly err, becauſe the firſt Councils actually did not err.</p>
               <p>§ XXV. It is not pretended that General Councils are Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in matters of Diſcipline, yet I am confident many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Ancients run as high for theſe as for matters of Faith. The firſt Council that ever was, that of the Apoſtles themſelves, <hi>Act.</hi> XV. was about matters of Diſcipline; and, as the Apoſtles there write, <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us,</hi> ſo the following Councils were perſuaded they had imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate directions from the Holy Ghoſt in things of this nature, which made the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> it ſelf urge the uniform obſervation of <hi>Eaſter</hi> in the ſame Terms and from the ſame Arguments that they uſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed. And afterwards <hi>Leo</hi> the Firſt,
<note place="margin">

               <p>§ XXVI. 1. For my part, I cannot but think it a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to imagin, that the Councils of latter times ſhould equal thoſe of the primitive Ages. For as the Ancients had grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantages than after Ages could have, to know what the Apoſtles taught, and how they explained their own Writings by their private Diſcourſes and their Sermons, and by their
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60211:47"/>Practice: ſo methinks it is highly reaſonable to ſuppoſe that they had greater aſſiſtences from above. For it ſeems requiſite and agreeable to God's methods of tranſacting with mankind, to afford eminent abilities to inſtruct men fully in Chriſtianity, to thoſe on whom he beſtowed a power of working Miracles to convince the World of the Truth of it; and we muſt in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conclude their Wiſedom in underſtanding the Scriptures, as well as their Miracles to atteſt it, and their Courage and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſuffering for it to have been ſupernatural. This cannot be denyed of the Apoſtles themſelves: And as it pleaſed God not to let Miracles ceaſe till he had raiſed up men of great Parts and Learning to undertake the Defence of his Religion, ſo we have the ſame reaſon to believe that he would not till then wholly withdraw his extraordinary Gifts and Illuminations; for theſe ſeem to have been as neceſſary againſt the many and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Hereſies ſo early ſprung, as thoſe to vindicate it againſt Infidels. We may well allow greater force to the Aſſertions of St. <hi>Clement,</hi> St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> &amp;c. than their Arguments may ſeem to carry, becauſe they may have more of a Divine Spirit in them than we are aware of, and ſo upon that account challenge a higher regard from us, than upon the ſcore onely of their Reaſonings. We muſt indeed ſtill keep to the Analogy of Faith, but why ſhould we too confidently make our ſelves Judges of their ways of arguing, eſpecially from Figures and Allegories? who would have known that the
<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Rock in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs</hi> was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> unleſs St. <hi>Paul</hi> had told him ſo? or, who would have underſtood the Allegory
<note n="b" place="margin">Galat. 4.</note> of the two Sons of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> unleſs he had explained it? How can we be aſſured, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, did not explain many more Types and make many more Allegorical Proofs than we have delivered to us in the Scriptures? 'Tis more than probable they did, in ſo many Sermons to the <hi>Jews</hi> always arguing from the Old Teſtament, inſtructed herein by our Saviour himſelf and by the Holy Ghoſt after his Aſcenſion, as their Followers and immediate Succeſſours likewiſe were. How then can we be aſſured but many of thoſe Allegorical Interpretations which ſome men preſume to ſet ſo light by, might be the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Apoſtles themſelves or of the Holy Ghoſt in theſe Apoſtolical men, as they have been juſtly ſtyled? Thoſe I mean delivered down by primitive Antiquity, made uſe of in all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60211:47"/>Ages, till men began to be ſo exceeding wiſe as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But as the Authority of Apoſtolical Traditions could reach no farther than the firſt Ages, ſo in ſucceeding times we have little reaſon to think that the Holy Ghoſt had much to doe in their Councils; Chriſt himſelf ſeems to have been almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, ſince <hi>Chriſt's Vicar,</hi> as he ſtyles himſelf, has had ſuch an abſolute ſway in Councils. <hi>Si dixerit aliquis, fiet recurſus ad Sedem &amp; Curiam Summi Pontificis, non negabimus hoc, ſi Theologia illic ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buerit duos Doctores non partiales, non ſeductos, non faſtuoſos, non quaeſtuoſos aut invidos, non poteſtati ſeculari, non ſpirituali, plus quàm veritati ſtudentes, alioquin tolerabilius eſſet nullos habere quàm tales pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi>
